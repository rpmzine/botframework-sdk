# Skill manifest JSON schema

This contains the current and previous versions of the JSON Schema that defines your skill manifest. For additional information on skills, skill consumers, and skill manifests see the [skills documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/skills-conceptual?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Published location

The skill manifest JSON schema is published at:

`https://schemas.botframework.com/schemas/skills/v{version}/skill-manifest.json`

Example:

`https://schemas.botframework.com/schemas/skills/v2.2/skill-manifest.json`

You should use the published version when referencing this schema.

## Legacy versions

With the release of the 2.1 version of the manifest, a different approach was taken to versioning. The `skill-manifest-2.0.0.json` and `skill-manifest-2.1.preview-1.json` files are left here for backwards compatibility purposes, and should not be used. Use the `\v{version}\skill-manifest.json` versions instead.
