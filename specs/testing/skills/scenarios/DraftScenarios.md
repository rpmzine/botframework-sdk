# Draft scenarios

This section contains raw ideas to be incorporated in the scenarios enumerated above

> The consumer is actively engaged with a skill in an adaptive dialog, the skill uses adaptive dialogs, and the skill wants to send a proactive message.

> The consumer is actively engaged with a _different_ skill in an adaptive dialog, the skill uses adaptive dialogs, and the skill wants to send a proactive message.

> The consumer is not engaged with a skill, the skill uses adaptive dialogs, and the skill wants to send a proactive message.

> The consumer is not engaged with a skill, the skill uses adaptive dialogs, and the skill wants to call `createConversation` in order to send a new proactive message.

> The consumer engages with a skill in a group conversation.

> The consumer engages with a skill in a group conversation. And the skill starts a DM conversation with one of the users

Using those examples, we can extrapolate a template for creating a realistic test scenario:

> The consumer is in `someVariableState`, the skill is in `someVariableState`, and the skill wants to `performSomeAction`.
